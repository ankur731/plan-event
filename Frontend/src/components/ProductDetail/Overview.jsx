            <p>Aplite Greenstone Heritage COME HOME TO THE CLASSIC In the heritage quarter of our city, the years have left their mark. In our race to
                modernity, we have made comfort a thing of the past. Now, all we ask of the city that never sleeps is a place to call home. A place to live life as
                it should be. The time has come to rediscover the things that made life beautiful. Let’s bring back living with charm. Meanwhile, in our vintage
                markets, the heart of Mumbai still beats on. Aplite Greenstone Heritage is a dream in that direction. The project, located in Mumbai’s Crawford
                Market area, reprises the classical elevation of this heritage locale. Presenting six towers, the architecture mixes utility with heritage, bringing
                you a classical home with a modern heart.</p>
